## Pipeline performance (`app/Actions/Pipeline/**`)

- [ ] **Chunked flow-rule scan can turn one query into several for a large, mostly-unanswered tree.**
      `ApplyFlow::findFlowTarget` (`app/Actions/Pipeline/ApplyFlow.php:95-98`) fetches
      `Rule::whereIn('view_id', chunk)` per 25-view chunk (`FLOW_RULE_CHUNK_SIZE`), stopping at the first
      firing rule. Worst case — a fresh Configuration on a large tree, nothing answered yet — is now
      `ceil(candidates / 25)` sequential queries, where the pre-chunking code paid for this once via the
      already-eager-loaded `rules` on the single full-tree query. `PipelineQueryCountTest`'s "large tree"
      case only builds `extraStepCount: 15`, under the chunk size, so it doesn't exercise the multi-chunk
      path and wouldn't catch a regression here. Pick up when: profiling shows multiple `Rule` queries on a
      cold load of a configurator with >25 unanswered top-level steps, or add a test case that pushes past
      the chunk size to confirm the trade-off is acceptable as-is.
